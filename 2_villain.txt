I would like here to give the technical, perhaps more scientific, interpretation of this cave which Hercules entered.
A fire-breathing monster with a lion’s head and a body of many snakes which dwelt in a swamp near Lerna, close to Argos, was sent by Hera to torment Hercules’ home town.
Angered, Hercules stormed towards the cave. Monster attacked Hercules by spewing fire and smoke, while Hercules responded with tree branches and rocks the size of millstones.
